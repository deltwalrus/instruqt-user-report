# instruqt-user-report
Python script wrapper for GraphQL query to parse organization(s) for members and their Instruqt roles

## Requirements
`pip` packages:
- `requests`
- `json`
- `argparse`

## Usage
`python user_report.py --api_key team-abcd1234 --api-key team-xyz-5678 ...`

Accepts an arbitrary number (greater than zero) of API keys as arguments and formats output nicely by org.

## Acknowledgements
Harpreet for the initial script and (most improtably) the GraphQL query that makes this go
Ad√© Mochtar for suggesting this approach
Josh Clough for his guidance on getting this done
